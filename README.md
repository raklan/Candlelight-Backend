# Candlelight-Backend

This should be the main source of the backend from now on. Ryan is working on making things more automated, but in the meantime, if you close this repo, you can run the backend server (as well as the database) by navigating to the candlelight-backend folder (root folder of the repository) and running
`docker compose up`
